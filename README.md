# Background-Subtraction-Project
Implementing Background Subtraction in a dynamic dataset for a street road project is to accurately detect and extract foreground objects or entities in an street images, thereby facilitating robust and real-time monitoring of the street environment.

Objective
Import Libraries and Define Auxiliary Functions

Dynamic Background Modeling

Incorporate mechanisms for dynamically updating the background model to account for gradual environmental changes

Integration with Road Infrastructure

Integrate the background subtraction module seamlessly with other components of the street road project, such as traffic signal control systems or automated surveillance systems.
